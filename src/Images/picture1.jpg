By consolidating domestic and international workforce management, you can streamline HR processes, reduce administrative overhead, and deliver fast and reliable payroll. Deel simplifies US PEO and global workforce management with an all-in-one platform for direct employees, EOR employees, and independent contractors. If your company manages employees in the US and internationally, you\u2019re likely familiar with the complexities of juggling multiple payroll and HR management platforms. In 2022, more than a third of companies utilized between 6 and 10 HR systems, while others used upwards of 20. Switching between multiple workforce management platforms can be feasible for smaller teams, but the more an organization expands, the more critical it becomes to find an all-in-one HR system, such as Deel. This article explores how centralizing US and global HR operations can streamline processes, boost efficiency, and empower you to manage your entire workforce from one cohesive platform. How using separate HR platforms inhibits growth Most HR platforms aren\u2019t built for international teams. Instead, they hold back companies from streamlining operations and expanding into new markets. Here\u2019s a look at the most common challenges that HR and payroll teams encounter. Lack of global support Many companies with US employees rely on HR platforms tailored to the US market, limiting their support for other employment types and geographies. These platforms typically don\u2019t have the functionality or expert backing to navigate international employment laws and requirements, such as: Worker classification status Country-specific payroll deductions and taxes Minimum wage requirements Local banking regulations for payment methods Without global support, companies must use additional management software for employees in other countries, losing out on a centralized overview of their workforce. Human errors from inconsistent processes Using several different payroll and HR tools can increase the chance of human error, leading to mistakes in employee onboarding processes for new hires, offboarding, documentation, and payroll processing. Payroll mistakes cost the average company $27,000 annually and can dilute workers\u2019 trust and positive perception of your organization, leading them to question your financial status and management capabilities. Multiple platforms also mean multiple reporting dashboards, which fail to provide HR teams with a complete overview of the HR data and metrics required to make informed business decisions. Instead, companies should look for a platform that offers a global view of their entire workforce, along with add-ons to track employee engagement and talent management. As we have more companies who want to see their full workforce analytics, it\u2019s become critical to have that global approach\u2014do I need to hire a consultant, or is my team able to do it ourselves because it\u2019s so user friendly? Am I replacing three of my other vendors because now I can access everything in one consolidated place for my team? Casey Bailey, Head of People, Deel via Benefits News Duplicated costs The financial burden of maintaining multiple systems can be significant, especially considering the potential overlap in functionalities and resources. HR teams don\u2019t use one-third of their software on a regular basis, and say the top functional redundancies are found in payroll (69%), applicant tracking (68%), HRIS (63%), and benefits administration software (63%). Each platform requires separate licenses, maintenance fees, and potentially additional integration expenses. Some platforms may have fluctuating pricing prohibiting your finance department from budgeting accurately, whereas a centralized platform like Deel has a flat, predictable rate with no hidden fees. Using Deel as your global HR software solution reduces the total cost of your tech stack by tens of thousands of dollars annually, as it replaces 16+ HR and payroll tools with one. We couldn't find true global HR. So we built our own. Get a look into the data, conversations, and motivations that led us to create Deel HR, the only global-first HR system for any worker. Higher security risks The more payroll providers and HR platforms you use, the more dispersed your employee data and sensitive company information becomes, increasing your vulnerability to security risks. You not only have to vet each company\u2019s data security and privacy practices for local jurisdictions, but you must also ensure they comply with cross-border regulations such as GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation).

<p>If your company manages employees in the US and internationally, you’re likely familiar with the complexities of juggling multiple payroll and HR management platforms.&nbsp;</p>
<!--more-->
<p>In 2022,<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.applaudhr.com/2023-digital-employee-experience-trend-report">more than a third of companies</a><span>&nbsp;</span>utilized between 6 and 10 HR systems, while others used upwards of 20. Switching between multiple workforce management platforms can be feasible for smaller teams, but the more an organization expands, the more critical it becomes to find an all-in-one HR system, such as Deel.</p>
<p>This article explores how centralizing US and global HR operations can streamline processes, boost efficiency, and empower you to manage your entire workforce from one cohesive platform.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>How using separate HR platforms inhibits growth</h2>
<p>Most HR platforms aren’t built for international teams. Instead, they hold back companies from streamlining operations and expanding into new markets. Here’s a look at the most common challenges that HR and payroll teams encounter.</p>
<h3>Lack of global support</h3>
<p>Many companies with US employees rely on HR platforms tailored to the US market, limiting their support for other employment types and geographies. These platforms typically don’t have the functionality or expert backing to navigate international employment laws and requirements, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.deel.com/blog/misclassification-of-employees-as-independent-contractors">Worker classification</a><span>&nbsp;</span>status</li>
<li>Country-specific payroll deductions and taxes</li>
<li><a href="https://www.deel.com/blog/minimum-wage-by-country">Minimum wage requirements</a></li>
<li>Local banking regulations for payment methods&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p><br>Without global support, companies must use additional management software for employees in other countries, losing out on a centralized overview of their workforce.</p>
<h3>Human errors from inconsistent processes</h3>
<p>Using several different payroll and HR tools can increase the chance of human error, leading to mistakes in employee onboarding processes for new hires, offboarding, documentation, and payroll processing.</p>
<p>Payroll mistakes cost the average company<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.hrdive.com/news/employers-make-15-corrections-per-pay-period-on-average-costing-thousands/640276/">$27,000 annually</a><span>&nbsp;</span>and can dilute workers’ trust and positive perception of your organization, leading them to question your financial status and management capabilities.</p>
<p>Multiple platforms also mean multiple reporting dashboards, which fail to provide HR teams with a complete overview of the HR data and metrics required to make informed business decisions. Instead, companies should look for a platform that offers a global view of their entire workforce, along with add-ons to track employee engagement and talent management.</p>

</div>
<h3>Duplicated costs</h3>
<p>The financial burden of maintaining multiple systems can be significant, especially considering the potential overlap in functionalities and resources. HR teams<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.capterra.com/resources/hr-software-redundancy">don’t use one-third of their software</a> on a regular basis, and say the top functional redundancies are found in payroll (69%), applicant tracking (68%), HRIS (63%), and benefits administration software (63%).</p>
<p>Each platform requires separate licenses, maintenance fees, and potentially additional integration expenses. Some platforms may have fluctuating pricing prohibiting your finance department from budgeting accurately, whereas a centralized platform like Deel has<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.deel.com/pricing">a flat, predictable rate</a><span>&nbsp;</span>with no hidden fees.&nbsp;Using Deel as your global HR software solution reduces the total cost of your tech stack<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.deel.com/blog/local-vs-global-hris-solutions">by tens of thousands of dollars annually</a>, as it replaces 16+ HR and payroll tools with one.</p>

<h3>Higher security risks</h3>
<p>The more payroll providers and HR platforms you use, the more dispersed your employee data and sensitive company information becomes, increasing your vulnerability to security risks. You not only have to vet each company’s data security and privacy practices for local jurisdictions, but you must also ensure they comply with cross-border regulations such as GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation).</p>

<h2>How Deel’s all-in-one HR system supports your team</h2>
<p>Deel makes global workforce management easy by combining US PEO with international payroll, HR, and compliance in a single platform.</p>
<h3>Eliminate duplicate work</h3>
<p>Companies spend an average of 300+ hours per month juggling their payroll tools and HR admin. Deel helps reduce that workload by bringing local and global payroll, employee benefits management, and HR into one platform. With automated processes and a unified view of your entire workforce, your team can focus on core HR tasks and business needs, instead of repetitive manual work.</p>

  <span>“Deel helped facilitate EEG’s onboarding of the entire team and provided a solution to centralize all their global payroll software. With locally compliant documents and flexible payment options,</span><strong><span>&nbsp;</span>Deel transformed days of work into a few hours<span>&nbsp;</span></strong><span>and made managing acquisitions a breeze.” —&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.deel.com/en/case-studies/esports-entertainment-group">EEG Case Study</a>

<h3>Access competitive benefits packages and administration</h3>
<p>With Deel, you can access big-company benefits for less than you’re paying today while ensuring compliance with federal, state, and local benefit laws.</p>
<p>Deel’s US PEO service can administer mandatory and voluntary benefits packages per local requirements, including health insurance such as Medicare, retirement savings plans like 401(k), unemployment insurance, and more. We also help US employers navigate COBRA administration and the complex employer reporting requirements included under the Affordable Care Act (ACA) regulations.</p>
<h3>Fortify your international compliance&nbsp;</h3>
